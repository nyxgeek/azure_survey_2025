# Statistics on Appended Digits to Usernames

Many companies will append a digit to a username when they "run out of space" and start running into username collisions. (E.g.: jsmith -> jsmith1, jsmith2, jsmith3, etc)

For purposes of this, only UPNs matching '^[a-z]{1,}[0-9]{1,}@' were filtered on, to exclude purely numeric usernames.
